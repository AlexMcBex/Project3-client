# Project W3 -Client

## Overview

This is the Client of [Project ***W***3 Back End](https://github.com/AlexMcBex/Project3-BackEnd)

Project ***W***3 (temporary name) is a full-stack application that allows you to create your own goals list and share it with the world! (or keep it private if you prefer)
Each goal has 3 main components:
- ***W***hat: what you want to achieve
- ***W***hen: a deadline for your goal or, if you're not a fan of timers, when your goal starts
- ***W***hy: that's what makes your goal special and unique, the ***W***hy, your specific reason and motivation to achieve your goal!

You can browse other users' goals and motivate them by leaving a like or a comment and, if you really like their goal, you can copy it on your own list.
